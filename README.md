## Description

_ This program is intended as a simple test of C#. It will run a simple ping-pong operation by displaying "ping"/"pong"/"ping-pong" depending on the number.

// Numbers up to the users input are displayed. (EX When 60 is inputted: numbers 1-60 appear.)
// When a number divisible by 3 is reached: display "ping" (EX: When 6 is reached: "Ping")
// When a number divisible by 5 is reached: display "pong" (EX: When 10 is reached: "Pong")
// When a number divisible by both numbers is reached: display "ping-pong" (EX: When 30 is reached: "Ping-Pong")
